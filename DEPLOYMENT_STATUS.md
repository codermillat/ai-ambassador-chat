### 3. Build and Deployment
✅ Code committed to GitHub: `3e071dd`
✅ Pushed to main branch
✅ Vercel will auto-deploy from GitHub

## 📊 Data Coverage

- **60+ Question-Answer Pairs**

- **All Fee Ranges**: ₹75,000 (Ph.D.) to ₹25,40,649 (MD/MS)
- **4 Scholarship Groups** fully documented
- **Year-wise Fee Breakdowns** for 2-6 year programs

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Loading Flow:
```
1. App starts
   ↓
2. datasetService.loadDataset() called
   ↓
3. Load verified data from /data/verified-fees-scholarships-2024.json
   ↓
4. Load Hugging Face dataset (500 entries)
   ↓
5. Merge: [Verified Data (60+)] + [HF Data (500)] = Total Dataset
   ↓
6. Ready for RAG queries
```

### Search Priority:
- Verified data appears first in the dataset array
- Similarity search scores favor earlier entries
- Result: Verified data always takes precedence

## 🎯 Example Questions Now Answerable

## 🚀 Deployment Timeline

1. **First Commit** (`41135aa`): Added verified data to `/data/` folder
   - Issue: Vite doesn't serve files from `/data/` folder
   - Data file returned 404 on Vercel

2. **Second Commit** (`3e071dd`): Moved to `/public/data/` folder
   - ✅ Fixed: Vite now includes data in build
   - ✅ Data accessible at `/data/verified-fees-scholarships-2024.json`
   - ✅ Deployed to Vercel

## 🧪 Testing the Deployment

Once Vercel deployment completes (usually 1-2 minutes), you can test:

1. **Open**: https://ai-ambassador-chat.vercel.app
2. **Navigate to**: AI ambassador tab
3. **Click**: "Chat with AI" button
4. **Check console logs**:
   - Should see: `✅ Verified data loaded: 60 entries`
   - Should see: `✅ Dataset loaded: 60 verified + 500 HF = 560 total entries`

5. **Ask test questions**:
   - "What is the fee for B.Tech CSE?"
   - "What scholarship can I get with GPA 4.0 for BBA?"
   - "Is MBBS eligible for scholarship?"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If data doesn't load:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify file is accessible: https://ai-ambassador-chat.vercel.app/data/verified-fees-scholarships-2024.json
3. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear browser cache

### If bot doesn't give correct answers:
1. Check console: Should show "60 verified entries"
2. Clear chat history and start new chat
3. Rephrase question to match Q&A pairs in the JSON
